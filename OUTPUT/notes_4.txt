Week number
----------------------
Using DAX functioin to add calendar columns:
-We're adding new columns
1.Add the formula:
Year= YEAR('Calendar'[Date])

2.Add the formula:
Month No.= MONTH('Calendar'[Date])

3.Add the formula:
Month= FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"MMM")

4.Select "Month" column, select "Sort by column" from above-->"Month no."

5.Add the formula:
Weekday No.= WEEKDAY('Calendar'[Date],1)
!!(1 means sunday, 2-->monday, 3-->??)

6.Add the formula:
Day Name= FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"DDD")

-Anything in a column can be used in a visual

7.Add the formula:
Week Number= WEEKNUM('Calendar'[Date],1)
----------------------
1.Look at calendar columns in "visual view"

2.In "page 3", Add a line chart

3.in the x-axis add "Year"-->"Month"-->"Week number"

4.Select "Day Name" column, select "Sort by column" from above-->"Weekday no"

5.Remove from the line chart all in x-axis, then add "Year"-->"Day Name"

6.Add the formula:
Qarter=FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"\QQ")
!!(the"\" keeps the the first "Q" as a letter)

7.Add the formula:
YQM= FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"YYYY- \QQ- MMM")

8.Remove from the line chart all in x-axis, then add "Year"-->"Quarter"-->"Week Number"

9.From the three dots on the chart select "sort axis"-->"Year Quarter Week NUmber"-->"Sort descending"
------------------
-In "fsalesdata", add a colummn:
1.Revenue= fsalesdata[Units Sold]*Related(dProducts[Price])

2.Add a "Revenue" sheet

3.Drag and drop "Revenue" and "Category" in a pie chart

4.Drag and drop "Revenue" and "Date" in a line chart

5.Drag and drop "Rvenue"

6.Change its visual type to "Card(new)",then add "Rvenue" two more times-->change type to "average", "count", then add "Units sold"

7.Change their names to "Revenue", "Average", "Count", "Units Sold"
-----------------
-Segmentation:
1.In "fsalesdata", Add new column formula:
Order volume= IF(fsalesdata[Units Sold]>30,"High Volume","Low Volume")

2.In "Revenue"  page, drag and drop "Revenue" and "Order Volume" in a pie chart

3.drag and drop "Order Volume" in a "slicer" visual 
--------------------------
1.Add a new page

2.from "Modeling", select "New table"

3.In the formula bar write "DAX =", then hit enter

4."DAX" table is added

5.Right click on "DAX" table, and add "new measure"

6.Order= COUNTROWS(fsalesdata); counting the number of the rows

!!(There arre two important adantages in this measure:
1-Creates the chart already named corecctly without the need to edit it over and over again;ex:if dragging "order" from "DAX" and "Region" from "fsalesdata" is much easier than dragging "Revenue" "Region" from "fsalesdata" then changing the "sum" to "count" and changing the chart's name
2-when clicking on "order", from "Measure tools" above, you can choose how the data appears; ex: thoushands' seperator,$ sign, etc.)

7.Right click on "DAX" table, and add "new measure"

8.Products= COUNTROWS(dProducts)

9.Right click on "DAX" table, and add "new measure"

10.Active Products= DISTINCTCOUNT(fsalesdata[Product])

11.Right click on "DAX" table, and add "new measure"

12.Active Products %= [Actrive Products]/[Products]

13.After dragging it, change it to a precentage from above

14.Right click on "DAX" table, and add "new measure"

15.Total Revenue = SUM(fsalesdata[Revenue])

16.From "Measure tools" above select $ sign, thoushands' seperator, 0 decimal places

17.Add the following:
1)All the DAX measures we did in a "Card(new)" visual
2)Drag "Region" and "Category" seperately
3)Drag "Order" from "DAX" and "Region" from "fsalesdata"

18.Look for the lacking\not active products by selecting from the "Category" table; noticing the "food" and "beverages" are missing in one product each

19.Add a "Gauge" visual, dragging and dropping "Total Revenue"-->"Format"-->"Gauge axis"-->change "Target" to 600000 and "Max" to 800000

20.Now you can select whatever you want to know its toal revenue comparing with the targrt and maximum

21.Drag and drop "Total Revenue" from "DAX" and "Sales Rep" from "dSalesperson", and changing the targrt to 30000 and maximum to
80000
