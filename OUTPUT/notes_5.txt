Instead of calculating and editing the average every time we use DAX formulas to implement the following:

1.Add a new page and name it "Analytics"

2.Add new measure in "DAX" table

3.Add following formula:
Average Revenue= AVERAGE(fSalesdata[Revenue])   ; Gets you the arthemitic mean

4.Add following formula:
Min Revenue= MIN(fSalesdata[Revenue])

5.Add following formula:
Max Revenue= MAX(fSalesdata[Revenue])

6.drage and drop "Total Revenue" in a "Card(new)" and add "Order", "Min Revenue", "Max Revenue", and "Average Revenue"

7.Add a text box making a title of "REVENUE DASHBORD"
------------------------
If you look at "Revenue" sheet, you'll see the carts built have a not so good title

1.By using "Total Revenue" from "DAX" drag "Category" on it in a pie chart, you'll see the title difference

2.To see more informatioin abiut the region you hover on, we can add tooltips page or from "Build a visual" beside the chart add in tooltips what you want:"Order", "Min Revenue", "Max Revenue", "Average Revenue"
-------------------------------
If in "Sold Units" sheet "Sum of Units Sold by Category" isn't made:
can we show information from another page ,like how we did in tooltips, or filter information in another page? YES
By using "Drilltrough"
ex:The page you choose to be "Drillthrough"<-->"Sold Units" will be the page be filterd from infromation according to the page you choose (aka the Source) choosing which table to Drill through from

1.From "Format" change page type to "Drillthrough"-->"Drill through from" choose "dCategories"-->"category"

2.Go to "Analytics" page, right click on what you want to filter from the visual--> "Drill through"-->"Sold Units"

3.It'll move you to the "Sold Units" page filtered by "Food" category

4.When you're done hold contol and click the back arrow buttoon in top left corner

5.Do the same by adding in "Drill through from"-->"dSalesperon"-->"Supervisor" and adding in "analytics" page a pie chart of "DAX"<->"Total Revenue" and "dSalesperson"<->"Supervisor"

!!Notice that when drill throgh in the category visual the "Sum of Units Sold by Category" will be one whole pie

You can expand "Filters" pane in "Sold Units" and add or remove from the pane itself
---------------------------------
1.Add new measure in "Dax" with the following formula:
Food Revenue= Calculate([Total Revenue],dCategories[Categoty]="food")   ; adding you exppresion and your filter 

2.Drag and drop it making it to 0 decimal, then click on food in the chart noticing it has the same value of revenue

3.Add this formula:
L.Y. Food Revenue= Calculate([Total Revenue],dCategories[Categoty]="food",dSalesReps[Supervisor]="L.Y")  ; adding another filter 

4.Drag and drop it making it to 0 decimal, then click on food in the chart and by holding contol & clicking on L.Y in the chart noticing it has the same value of revenue

5.Add this formula:
Food Revenue(>30 unit)= Calculate([Total Revenue],dCategories[Categoty]="food",fsalesdata[Units Sold]>30

6.Drag and drop it
-------------------------
Time Intelligence DAX: ability to show & compare current period, previous period, and same period last year

current period
QTD Month to Date; 1 Feb 2024-->6 Feb 2024
QTD Quarter to Date; 1 jan 2024-->6 Feb 2024
YTD Year to Date; 1 jan 2024-->6 Feb 2024

previous period
previous Month; Feb Vs Jan
previous Quarter; Q1-2024 Vs Q4-2023
previous Year; 2024 Vs 2023

same period last year
SMLY; Feb 2024 Vs Feb 2023
SQLY; Q1 2024 Vs Q1 2023
SPLY; 1 jan 2024-->6 Feb 2024 Vs 1 jan 2023-->6 Feb 2023

1.Add a new page, select "Calendar"<->"Date" and "DAX"<->"Total Revenue" in a matrix chart
!!(Make sure the numbers are 2 decimal places)

We want to calculate MTD Revenue

2.Add new measure of Farmula:
MTD Revenue= TOTALMTD([Total Revenue], 'Calendar'[Date])

3.Drag and drop; it'll show you all the sales done on the last month given in the calender we have

Repeat the previous calculating QTD and YTD

4.Add these Fromulas:
QTD Revenue= TOTALQTD([Total Revenue], 'Calendar'[Date])
YTD Revenue= TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], 'Calendar'[Date])

5.Add them to MTD card(new) visual

6.Add card(new) visual above the previous one containg "Total Revenue", "Average Revenue", and "Order"

7.Add this Fromula:
Previous Month= CALCULATE([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSMONTH('Calender'[Date]))

8.BY Dragging and dropping, it'll show blank unless you chose a month; ex:Feb 2019 will show jan 2019

Repeat the previous calculating Previous Month and Previous Month

9.Add these Fromulas:
Previous Quarter= CALCULATE([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSQUARTER('Calender'[Date]))
Previous Year= CALCULATE([Total Revenue],PREVIOUSYEAR('Calendar'[Date])

10.Add them to Previous month card(new) visual

!!Again this card(new) visual will show nothing when no time is selected

11.Add this Fromula:
SMLY= CALCULATE([MTD Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

12.Drag and drop Showing Decenber sales in 2018

Repeat the previous calculating SQLY and SPLY

13.Add these Fromulas:
SQLY= CALCULATE([QTD Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
SPLY= CALCULATE([YTD Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
----------------------------
!!If you choose any month or quarter in 2018, it'll show nothing in the "previous year", "SMLY", "SQLY", and "SPLY"

These numbers are really important in buisnesses and all you need is to refresh PowerBI whenever you add any new data

All of this are simple calculations as you can add precentages, other comparisons, etc..

1.An example using of these cards is to drag and drop "Calendar"<->"YQM" in a slicer visual selecting whatever you want

We have 3 slicer styles (Tile, Vetical list, Dropdown) you can select from "Format"-->"slicer settings"-->"Options"
---------------------------
Adding a background:

1.Make a background by Power Point and Save it as a ".png, .jpg, or .svg"

2.Add a new page in PowerBi, from "Format"-->"Canvas background"-->browse for the pic in "image"

3.Add a visual of "Date" and "Total Revenue", then from "Format"-->"Size and style"-->turn "background" to off

4.from "Format"-->"line"-->"Colors"-->choose "More colors"-->write the hex number you got from Power Point background

(You can choose a line style from: solid, smooth, step)

Now we want the icons in the picture clickable hyperlinks

5.From "Insert" above-->"Buttons"-->Choose "Blank" and fit it on the icon

6.Copy and paste the button and fit on the rest of the icons

7.Select all the buttons and from "Format"-->"Button style"-->turn "Border" off

8.Now to select a destention for any of them:
from "Format"-->turn on "Action"-->change "Type" to "Page navigation" and "destination" to the following:
"Home"(change page 1 name to Home), the next one to "Analytics"

9.control & click the buttons to reach the destination
------------------------
You can do that without putting in mind creating viusals and hyperlinks by selecting "Buttons" from "Insert"-->"Navigator"-->"Page navigator"

1.Do it in "Home" page
