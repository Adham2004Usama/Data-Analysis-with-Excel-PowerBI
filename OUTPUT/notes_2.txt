Understanding the rawdata??


Data Analysis Project
ETL-->Extract, Transform, and Load--> Power Query (Automatic)
Modeling--> Dax Data analysis Expression
Visusalization-->PowerBI
Sharing
--------------------------
1.Combining all sales excel files in one file with powerbi

2."Get Data"-->"Folder"-->Browse and find the sales folder

3.slect "Transform Data"

4.Need to get rid of any files other than csv by clicking on "Extention" filter and uncheck every file type except "csv"

5.click the filter on "content" column to combine files

6.For them to combine all columns' headers are the same and all the tables are with the same formation to avoid any errors or extra columns

7.Revise your data; as we must check in these three:
1)Title
2)Datatype
3)Data is valid with no errors

8.name the table "fsalesdata" where f stands for facts

9.If you clicked the error of the first column you'll see all the files combined

10.Changed its name with "Region"

11.We want to get rid of ".csv" from the "Region" column; using "transform"-->"extract"-->"extract before delimeter"--> the delimeter will be "."

12."transform"-->"format"-->"capatalize each word" while selecting "region" column

13.Now we look for errors if there is any

14."Close and apply"-->Wait for loading

15.Drag and drop units sold

16.Drag and drop units sold order date, then drag units sold to it

17.click on "expand all level down" arrow 

18.Do the same to region

19.Save the file naming it "PowerBI data analysis project
----------------------
1.Open "2-5-lookup-tables"

!!(note: there is a difference between table and range when reading them for building a query)

2.Selct the file from PowerBI from excel workbook

"f" means "facts", "d" means "dimensions"

3.name the files "dcategories", "dProducts", "dSalesReps"

4.Removing null from "dcategories", changing to currency in "dProducts", and use first row as headers in "dSalesReps" by "Home"-->"Use First Row as Headers" (or clicking the top left button on the table and slecting the comand)

5.Go to model view
-----------------------
1.Create connections by dragging one of what you want to connect and drop on the other.
!!(The "1" refers that it only written\mentioned once, the "*" refers that it written\mentioned more than once,(eg.:("dCategories connection with ddProducts"means"one to many"))

2.Go to "report view", build the following charts:
category<-->units sold from dCat..&fsal..
product<-->units sold from dPro..&fsal..
sales rep<-->units sold from dSal..&fsal..
team leader<-->units sold from dSal..&fsal..
supervisor<-->units sold from dSal..&fsal..
Region<-->units sold from fsal..

5.Add a text box and write"Units Sold Dashboard"

6.This dashbord is dynamic and changes with any changes you make in the data,So fo to module 2--> add north west file to the 2-4-sales folder--> Go and refresh the powerbi, then you'll find noticebly that "Units sold by region" will increase a bar
