Header buttons:
*Look at it inn the video*
Drill up ^, Drill down(arrow dived into two vv), (two arrows down), drill down mode focuses on whatever you select and want to get down

Filter sign:
-if clicked on a chart then select the filter sign of any char it'll read waht it has been filterred with

Focus mode:
- gets you to focus on specific chart

...:
-"Export data" export it as a csv file table
-"Show as a table" shows the table in case if you want to see the table before exporting the data.
-the rest is pretty much explained

Edit Interaction:
-when selecting something it highhlights its relatioships in every chart.
-we want to completely filter them, meaning to make others disappear
1.select any visual-->"Format"-->"Edit  interaction"
2.in eachh visual you'll have the following:
"none","highlight","filter"
-It is not necessary to do this as the highlighting does the job but if you want show that way you can.

Tooltibs:
-when putting the mouse on any of the bars it shows you info for that bar
1. select "units sold" from "fsalesdata"--> slect the thousand colon seperator from "Column tools" above
-Now every bar in the carts will have the colon
-You can also add your own tooltibs
1.slect "BUild a visual" next to "Product" chart
2.Make "Suggest a type" off
3.Add in "tooltips" "units sold" twice
4.Right click one of them-->"average" and the other-->"count"
5.Rename them "Average units sold", "Count of orders", and the x-axis "Total sold units"
-----------------
1.Add "units sold" twice, first change it to "count" and the other change it to "average" 
------------------
-The tooltips we made is only in that chart we edited, so we are going to make a tooltip page
1.Add a new page-->"Format"-->"Page infomation"-->"Page type"--"tooltip"
2.Select from above a visual type called "card (new)"
3.Add "Units sold" 3 times, sum, average, and count
-They'll be so big
4.Go to "Format"-->"Callout values"-->"values"--> change font size to 15, then go to "Label"-->change font size to 8 and "Horizintal alignment" to center
5.change the titles from "Build a visual": "Total", "Average", and "Orders"
----------------
-Now you need to apply it, go to "Sold Units" page
1.Select "Sum of units sold by region" chart-->"Format"-->"properties"-->"Options"-->"Page"-->change the page to "page 2"
2.Now start moving the mouse on the bars
3.Change "Page 2" to "tooltip 1"
------------------
-We made "tooltip 1" in Excel in a harder way; where in PowerBI we can add what need in one time
1.Add another "tooltip" page and change its name "tooltip 2"
2.from "fsalesdata"-->drag and drop both "Order Date" and "Units Sold"
-------------------
-go to "Sold Units" page
1.Select to "...by category" chart-->"format"-->"properties"-->"Options"-->"Page"-->change the page to "tooltip 2"
---------------------
1.Copy "tooltip 1" and paste it in "Sold Units" and delete the other 3 we added in "Sold Units" page
---------------------
1.Add another tooltip page dragging "Team Leader" and "Units Sold", then Select to "...by supervisor" chart-->"format"-->"properties"-->"Options"-->"Page"-->change the page to "tooltip 3"
--------------------
1.Add another tooltip page dragging "Region" and "Units Sold", then Select to "...by Team Leader" chart-->"format"-->"properties"-->"Options"-->"Page"-->change the page to "tooltip 4"
----------------------
-Enter the data of "stores" file from module 3 -->"Transform Data"
1.rename it to "dStore"
2.click on "storee" and uncheck "null"
3.Rename the "storee" to "store"
4."Close & Apply"
5.Go to "model view"
6.Connect "Store" to "Store ID"
8.Go to "Report view"
7.Add another page--> drag and drop "Store" from "dStore" and "Units Sold"
8.From "Add to your visual" you can add "Data labels"
-----------------------------
Append & Merge:
-Now it's all automated and all you need to do is adding the needed data and refreshing PowerBI
-In some charts in "Solid Units" sheet you'll read the word "(Blank)" in some charts
-ex: this "(Blank)" is for the messing product in the "dProducts" table in the "Table view"
-To know where the messing data in your dataset is:
1.Add new page
2.Choose "Table" visual dragging "product" from "fsalesdata" and "dProducts"
3.You'll see there are messing products' names
4.In this senario we got these messing names-->module 3-->text file "newproducts"-->"Transform Data"
5.Change "Price" column into "currency"
-All we want to do is to add the messing data we got from the text file to the "dProducts" table
6.Go to "dProducts" table-->"Append queries"-->Select "new-products"
7."Close & Apply"
8.3 products are added to the products
9.Go to "Model view" and delete any connections with "new-products" ad it's not needed
-------------------
-Sometimes you need to add some columns to the tables
1.Get data from "Module 3"-->"Costs" text file-->"Transform data"
!!(As you can see in the file before "Transform data" that that the 3 added products are not written)
2.Rename the "Sheet 1" table to "Cost"
3.Go to "dProducts" and select "Merge Queries" from above--> select "Cost"--> Select the two matching columns named "Product ID"-->click "Ok"
4.Click on the button beside the "Cost" column to expand by clicking "Ok"
5.Remove the "Cost-Product ID" Column and rename "Cost.Cost" to "Cost"
----------------
-The merging process can be done in a different way as follows:
From point 4. after clicking the expand button uncheck the "Use original column name as prefix" and "Product ID" as it's written in the "dProducts" table

5."Apply & Close"
6.Go to the "Costs" Excel file and add the the 3 messing products and their values, then refresh the PowerBI file
-------------------
1.Go to "dProducts" table in "Table view"
-----------------------
-You can hide "Cost" and "new-products" as they're not needed 
-----------------------
DAX (Data Analysis Expression):
1.Add "New Table" in "Table view"
2.In the formula bar write "Calendar ="--> CALENDARAUTO()
-Now we can costumize our columns by this table using DAX functions
--------------------
1.Add "South-East" file from module 3 to "2-4 sales" folder module 2, then refresh PowerBI
!!(this file contains data for year 2019)
-We are now using it as a main table in our dataset
2.Go to "Model view"--> connect "fsalesdata" "Order Date" with "Calendar""Date"
3.Now in "Page 1", remove the "Order Date" as it no more works and add "Date" from "Calender"
